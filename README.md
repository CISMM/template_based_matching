# template_based_matching

The CISMM Template-Based Matching program is designed to locate and identify objects within Scanned-Probe Microscope images and produce a file of descriptive statistics about these objects.

See the installer/template_based_matching.html file for more information, and the installer/template_afm_estimation.doc file for detailed information about the algorithm.
