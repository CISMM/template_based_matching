<h1>CISMM Template-Based Matching v01.05 Manual</h1>
<p>The <i>CISMM Template-Based Matching</i> program is designed to locate and 
  identify objects within Scanned-Probe Microscope images and produce a file of 
  descriptive statistics about these objects. See the Word document describing 
  this program for detailed information about the algorithms applied.</p>

<p><b>Thank-You Ware:</b> Rather than making you register to download our software 
  or join a mailing list or provide other personally-identifying material to use 
  our code, we've come up with the following easy and anonymous way for you to 
  let us know we're helping the community. When you press the &quot;Say Thank 
  You!&quot; button to let us know you appreciate having the tool, the application 
  sends a web query to our server and logs your response (not your name or your 
  phone number, just a web hit count). We add up these counts and report them 
  to the reviewers for our renewal applications when we ask NIBIB to continue 
  funding us to maintain our existing tools and to build new ones. Please press 
  the button whenever you feel like the tool has been helpful to you.</p>
<h2><img src="GUI.jpg" width="155" height="661" align="left"><img src="original.jpg" width="308" height="334" align="right">Main 
  Controls</h2>
<p>The control panel appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. If the program 
  was started by pulling an image onto the desktop icon, a set of image windows 
  will appear next to the control panel. If the program is started by clicking 
  on one of the icons, a dialog box will appear asking for a data file to open. 
  The data file can be an SPM file, or an image file such as TIFF or JPEG. Image 
  files will lose the metric information, so that size and volume comparisons 
  will only be relative. The image itself will appear in a window entitled <i>Original 
  Image</i> immediately to the right of the control panel (an example is seen 
  here to the right, it is the <i>test_field.unca</i> file that is found in the 
  default directory). This window includes three red '+' signs that can be moved 
  using the left mouse button. These marks should be moved to three places on 
  the substrate of the scan.</p>
<h2>Filtering Operations</h2>
<p>There are two filters that can be applied to the data. Each is on by default. 
  The <i>substrate_fit</i> filter attempts to remove the effects of tip-length 
  artifacts and other changes that cause individual scanlines to change their 
  height. It is similar to the &quot;line-by-line flattening&quot; operations 
  performed by AFM software, but it does more than simply make the average of 
  each line match that of the line before. Rather, it takes the median step from 
  one line to the next after filtering each line to remove the effects of noise.</p>
<p>The <i>median_filter</i> applies only to the process of determining connected-component 
  regions. It does not apply to the data used for fitting, or to the output image. 
  It is present to reduce the effects of noise, especially for the case of noisy 
  surfaces that are supposed to be flat. It is on by default.</p>
<h2><img src="flattened.jpg" width="308" height="334" align="right">Plane Fit</h2>
<p>A plane is fit through the three points, and it is used as an estimate of the 
  subtrate. This plane is subtracted from all data points, effectively shearing 
  the data sets so that the plane of the substrate is at Z=0.</p>
<h2>Connected Components</h2>
<p>At this point, the flattened image is searched for &quot;islands&quot; that 
  poke up above a &quot;sea level&quot; that is set using the <i>height_threshold</i> 
  control. This control is set to the fraction of the maximum height that a pixel 
  must have to stick above the &quot;waterline&quot;. Objects that touch the edge 
  of the image are discarded and drawn in a lighter blue color.</p>
<h2>Loading Templates</h2>
<p><img src="template.jpg" width="123" height="84" align="left">Before going any 
  further, you should load the templates (by repeatedly selecting the <i>Add Template</i> 
  button and selecting the templates one at a time. (Do it now because later steps 
  make this much slower). Each template will show up in a window that looks like 
  the one on the left. The particular template shown is the <i>dimer_180.unca</i> 
  template from the default directory. Load each template that you want to get 
  from a file before going on. You might create templates using the <i>CISMM Microscope 
  Simulator</i> program, which is available from the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/nano/cismm/download/index.html">software 
  download page</a>. If you want to select templates from the image itself, this 
  will have to be done later.</p>
<h2><img src="proteins.jpg" width="260" height="273" align="right">Dilation and 
  Thresholding</h2>
<p>Next, select the desired settings for <i>dilation</i> and the <i>Volume Thresholds</i>. 
  The dilation spreads out each object &quot;island&quot; by the specified number 
  of pixels. This will recover volume from the islands that is below the waterline. 
  If this spreading causes two islands to meet, or an island to meet the edge 
  of the image, the merged islands will turn light blue and be removed from consideration. 
  Some such blue islands are shown in the image to the right.</p>
<p>Adjust the Volume Threshold sliders to select islands only of the appropriate 
  size. These are set to the fraction of the maximum-volume object that should 
  be selected. Objects whose volumes are above the top threshold or below the 
  lower threshold will turn red and are removed from further consideration. An 
  example of such removed islands is shown to the right from an image that comes 
  from Dorothy Erie's lab showing protein complexes. The objects that remain gray 
  are the ones that will be matched against the templates.</p>
<h2>Creating new Templates from the Image (Optional)</h2>
<p>If you want to use objects in the image itself as templates, first dilate the 
  image enough that a good surround for each object is produced (5 pixels, perhaps). 
  Then click on the object in the <i>Flattened</i> window that you want to make 
  into a template. This will bring up a dialog box that lets you specify the name 
  of the template file to save this object in, and it will also load it into the 
  list of templates to be compared against. Parts of the image that are outside 
  of the dilated object are set to zero, so they will match substrate best.</p>
<p>Once saved, these templates can be re-used on other images. Note that for microscope 
  image formats, rescanning at different sizes will be properly compensated for: 
  the template will retain its real-world size independent of the scan resolution 
  or scan size. This will not be true for image file formats (TIFF, JPEG), which 
  don't have metric information telling their pixel sizes.</p>
<h2>Angle and Pixel Step</h2>
<p>The final settings are the angle and pixel step to take when attempting to 
  match the templates to each object. The <i>angle_step</i> setting tells how 
  much to rotate each template between attempts at matching. The <i>pixel_step</i> 
  control tells how far to shift the templates when comparing them. The center 
  of mass of the template is translated to match the center of mass of the object, 
  so it is possible that a large setting will be acceptible, and it is much faster 
  to use a large setting.</p>
<h2>Optimizing and Saving Results</h2>
<p>Once the above settings have been made, it is time to run the template match. 
  This is done by pressing the <i>Save</i> button and selecting the name of the 
  comma-separated-values (CSV) file that holds the information about the best 
  matches. A progress window appears, showing how many templates have been tested 
  against each object. When the object counter has counted up to its maximum, 
  and all templates have been tested against it, the window will close and the 
  CSV file will contain the matches (as described below). You can cancel the operation 
  using the <i>cancel</i> button in the progress window (it will stop after the 
  current template-vs-object test is complete).</p>
<h2><img src="best_fit.jpg" width="260" height="273" align="right">Best-Fit Window</h2>
<p>Once optimization has completed, visual display of the best-fit objects is 
  provided in a third image window that is initially located below the <i>Flattened</i> 
  window. This window is named <i>Best Fit</i>, and it displays the best-fit template 
  for each object, translated and rotated to its best-fit location based on the 
  angle and pixel steps provided, and resampled into the same space as the original 
  image. The image to the right shows the result when the example templates are 
  used with 10-degree orientation testing on the image from Dorothy Erie's laboratory 
  shown above.</p>
<p>If no templates are loaded, the components themselves will be splatted into 
  this window. Note that they may not look exactly like they did in the original 
  image because they will have been shifted to their center of mass and resampled.</p>
<h2>Labeling</h2>
<p>If the <i>show_labels</i> checkbox is checked, the identifiers from the connected 
  components will be drawn in the best-fit window. These will match the component 
  ids stored in the file, and can be useful to provide a map of which component 
  was where in the image.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Output File Format</h2>
<p>The <i>comma-separated-values</i> (CSV) file written by the program is intended 
  to be loaded into a spreadsheet program or another data-analysis program. It 
  consists of a header line and then one line for each of the objects in the image. 
  The header line contains the following text names: descriptions of each are 
  included here, but are not included in the file.</p>
<p>If no templates have been loaded, only the center of mass and volume entries 
  will be filled in.</p>

<h1>Version Information</h1>
<p>Version 01.05:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removing need to link with the NSRG Runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Version 01.04:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removing inactive &quot;Change DataSet&quot; button.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Version 01.03:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added &quot;Say Thank You!&quot; button to let users let us know when the 
    software makes them happy.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Version 01.02:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switched to a median-offset-based line-by-line flattening, which keeps the 
    whole line from moving down when a tall object is present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 01.01:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a low-pass-filter based line-by-line flattening filter to help remove 
    scanline artifacts without modifying the volume estimates. This should let 
    us work on non-flattened data without trouble from bowing artifacts.</li>
  <li>Added a median filter to the data used for connected-component calculation, 
    to reduce the effect of noise.</li>
  <li>Added the option to label regions on the best-fit display.</li>
  <li>Added the option to save without defining any templates: the program stores 
    just the volume and centering information and splats the actual data back 
    into the window, rather than splatting templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 01.00:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial release. Tested with example templates and a file made to exactly 
    match them.</li>
  <li>Known bug: If the templates have a lower sampling resolution (smaller size) 
    than the objects in the main window, this resampling will cause spikes of 
    value with zeroes around them within the objects, making a very broken-up 
    picture.</li>
